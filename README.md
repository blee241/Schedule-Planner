# Schedule Planner

## Description

This simple planner can be used to schedule a standard work day. It features different colors to visually represent time in the past, present, and future. This project was made in order to practice using third party APIs and other basic coding principles.

## Installation

This application requires no installation. Find it here: https://blee241.github.io/Schedule-Planner/.

## Usage

The scheduler features a total of nine time blocks. Each one represents one hour in a standard nine-to-five work day schedule.

The color of the time blocks will change depending on the local time of your computer. Gray indicates that the hour has already passed. Red indicates the current hour. Green indicates that the time block is in the future.

Each time block can be clicked on. To save an event on the planner, click on a time block and type to enter text into it. There is a blue save button to the right of each time block. Click on the save button to save the text into the local storage. The text will remain after refreshing or leaving the site.
